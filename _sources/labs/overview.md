# Labs Overview

Labs are intended to give you hands-on programming experience. 

You'll have a lab each week, which is intended to be completed during section. Note that if you can't physically attend section (or are working asynchronously), that's totally fine. The benefit of working during section is that you'll have quick access to the excellent Teaching Assistants (and your classmates) if you have questions.

## Labs are collaborative.  

You can (and should!) work with other classmates.  

In general, programming is often a team sport. You'll find that to be true in both software engineering and data science. Thus, labs are a good opportunity to practice working with others.
