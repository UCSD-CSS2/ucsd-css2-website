# Final Project: Overview

As part of the course, you must complete a **final project**.

You can think of the final project as a larger, more coherent problem set. Like the problem sets, you'll be graded for correctness (and you should complete it independently). But unlike the problem sets, the questions in this final project will *build* towards a larger conclusion––you'll produce a small piece of working software and data analysis.

## Goals

Like the labs and problem sets, the goal of this final project is to give you hands-on experience programming in Python.

Unlike the other assessments, the final project is intended to be a more **coherent** exercise.

## The final project is completed independently.

Again, you can think of this like a bigger problem set: it'll be graded for correctness, and you should work on it independently.
