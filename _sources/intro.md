# Welcome to CSS 2!

CSS 2 | Sean Trott | Winter 2024 | UCSD

## Course Overview

This course will teach how you to think about **data** and **modeling** for **computational social science**. 

- How is a dataset **formatted**, and is this the appropriate format for what I want to do? 
- Is this dataset **representative** or does it reflect a **biased sample**? 
- What **ethical considerations** should I take into account when obtaining and analyzing data? 
- What kind of **model** is the most appropriate for these data? 
- How do I **design and implement** these models––ranging in complexity from [linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression) to [support vector machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine)? 

This course is one of the [**three core courses** for the CSS Minor at UCSD](https://css.ucsd.edu/undergraduate-minor/index.html), along with CSS 1 and CSS 100. Note that CSS 1 is a prerequisite for this course; please see the [course expectations](course/expectations.md) page for more information.
