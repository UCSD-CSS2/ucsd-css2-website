# Problem Sets: Overview

Problem sets are **bi-weekly** (as in one roughly *every two weeks*) programming exercises, intended to give you more hands-on experience applying course concepts.

## Problem sets are completed independently.

Unlike labs, problem sets should be completed **independently**. You can ask the TAs (or me) for help, but each answer should reflect your own work.

## Problem sets are graded for correctness. 

Unlike labs, your grade on a problem set will reflect how many questions you answered **correctly**.

## Note on auto-grading

Note that grading will be done using an **auto-grader**. This is a piece of software that will check your solutions to each problem and determine whether or not it is correct. 

For the auto-grader to work correctly, it's very important that you don't *edit* or *delete* any notebook cells that contain an `assert` statement.
